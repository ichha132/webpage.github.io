subject gained through involvement in or exposure to it.[1] 
Terms in philosophy such as "empirical knowledge" or "a posteriori knowledge" are used to refer to knowledge based on experience. 
A person with considerable experience in a specific field can gain a reputation as an expert. 
The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge:
 on-the-job training rather than book-learning.

The interrogation of experience has a long term tradition in continental philosophy. 
Experience plays an important role in the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard.
 The German term Erfahrung, often translated into English as "experience", has a slightly different implication, 
connoting the coherency of life's experiences.
